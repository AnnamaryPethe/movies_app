# Movie app

This is a base movie app where you can find the most popular movies in the past two weeks on the home page, and than search a movie by title.

You can start the project using npm start, this command starts the backend and frontend in the same time.
The only thing that you need to do is to set up the env vars (.env.example file can help).
